![fraudulent-transactions-concept-illustration_114360-1556](https://github.com/cosmicishan/Anamoly-Detection/assets/37193732/82ea0e02-1dc7-4f01-940b-b4a6ff51ac7a)


<h1>Overview</h1>
The objective of this project is to create a machine-learning model capable of precisely detecting fraudulent transactions. By utilizing a dataset comprising both legitimate and fraudulent transactions, we aim to train a machine-learning algorithm to identify patterns and characteristics indicative of fraudulent activities. The developed fraud detection model is designed to recognize and flag suspicious transactions, contributing to a more secure financial environment.

<h2>Project Background</h2>
Fraudulent activities in financial transactions can lead to significant financial losses and compromise the integrity of financial systems. This project aims to develop a robust machine-learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions, thereby enhancing fraud prevention and security measures.

<h2>Data Download</h2>

<h2>Dataset Description</h2>
The dataset used for this project contains transactional data with various attributes, including transaction type, amount, account balances, and time of the transaction. The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables, and exploratory data analysis has been conducted to gain insights into the data distribution and transaction patterns.

<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps, including:

* Handling missing values
* Handling outliers
* Addressing multicollinearity
* Converting categorical variables to numerical representations
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* The exploratory data analysis phase involved visualizing and analyzing key aspects of the dataset, such as transaction types, amounts, balances, and transaction timings. Insights gained from this analysis helped inform feature selection and model development.

<h2>Modeling</h2>
Three different machine learning algorithms were employed for building the fraud detection model:

* Random Forest
* Decision Trees
* Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
  
Each model was trained on a balanced dataset to address class imbalance and evaluated using various metrics, including confusion matrices, classification reports, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the ROC curve.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
The performance of each model was assessed based on its ability to correctly classify fraudulent and valid transactions. Key evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. Feature importance analysis was conducted to identify the most significant predictors of fraudulent transactions.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

The model identified several key features that are indicative of fraudulent transactions, including:

* Transaction amount
* Account balances (oldbalanceOrg and newbalanceDest)
* Transaction type (TRANSFER and CASH_OUT)


<h2>Preventive Measures</h2>

To prevent fraudulent activities and enhance security, the following measures are recommended:

* Real-time transaction monitoring
* Multi-factor authentication
* Behavioral analysis
* Implementation of machine learning models for fraud detection
* Ongoing employee training and education
* Collaboration with industry peers and regulatory bodies
